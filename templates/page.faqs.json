The pad breaks down in two parts; firstly, the hydraulic action of the toilet flush pulls the layers of the pad apart as it starts travelling down the drain. Then, the layers break down into 3mm pant fibres.   Our materials and manufacturing process ensure that your pad will have disintegrated by the time it reaches your local municipal plant in a few hours"

After binning, your local council will either send the contents of your bin to landfill, or it will be incinerated (and neither are good news for the environment). Once binned, we lose control of where the pad ends up. If it gets sent to landfill, we cannot guarantee the right environment for it to biodegrade. Incineration produces harmful greenhouse gases.   Flushable pads give you back the control of where it ends up. Once flushed, the pads will biodegrade into clean water, renewable energy and fertiliser at your local water treatment centre."

You can also wave goodbye to permanent period waste, as a Planera pad fully degrades in 30 days, whilst the market-leading pad takes around 500 years. <br> <br> We will be looking to do more LCAs in the future to understand the impact of a Planera pad vs. other period products on the market."
